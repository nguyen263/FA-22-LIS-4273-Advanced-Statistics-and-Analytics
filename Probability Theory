What is the probability of operating on 10 patients successfully with the traditional method?
A hint, use dbinom function â€“ it is part of R functions that count Density, distribution function, quantile function, and random generation for the binomial distribution with parameters size and prob.

You will answer this question with
dbinom(XXX, size=XXX, prob=XXX)

#dbinom(x, size, prob)
#x = a vector of numbers; 0
#size = the number of trials; 10 patients
#prob = probability of success on each trial; 20%
dbinom(0, 10, .2)
